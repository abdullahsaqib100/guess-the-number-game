Guess the Number Game is a fun and interactive console-based game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number by the system(code) within a given range.
The program provides hints such as "higher" or "lower" based on the player's guess, making it an engaging challenge. It tracks the number of attempts taken by the player
to guess the correct number.

𝐅𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬:
i. Random number generation between a specified range (1 to 25).
ii. User-friendly interface with clear prompts and instructions.
iii. Hints provided to help the player adjust their guesses (e.g., "Your guess is too high" or "Your guess is too low").
iv. Tracks the number of attempts taken to guess the correct number.
iv. Error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., when a non-integer is entered)

𝐇𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐨 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐲?
i. Run the program, and the system will randomly select a number between 1 and 25.
ii. You will be prompted to guess the number.
iii. If your guess is too high or too low, the system will inform you, and you can adjust your guess accordingly.
iv. Once you guess the correct number, the system will congratulate you and display the number of attempts you took to guess correctly.
v. Enjoy and try to guess the number in as few attempts as possible!

𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤:
𝗣𝘆𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗻: The game is developed using Python 3. Python’s built-in libraries such as random are used to generate random numbers, and
error handling is implemented to manage invalid inputs.

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐩𝐭𝐬 𝐂𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐝:
𝗶. 𝗥𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗼𝗺 𝗡𝘂𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿 𝗚𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: The game uses Python's random library to generate a number between 1 and 25, providing randomness for each playthrough.
𝗶𝗶. 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗟𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰: The core of the game logic revolves around if, elif, and else conditions, which determine if the guessed number is higher or lower
than the target number.
𝗶𝗶𝗶. 𝗘𝗿𝗿𝗼𝗿 𝗛𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗴: To enhance user experience, error handling (try-except) is included to ensure the program doesn’t crash when an invalid input (such as a string) is entered.
